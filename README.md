## Realized architectures for Adversarial Training (mostly GANs) on the basis of PyTorch

Each folder is isolated and "self-sufficient", they can be putted as an appropriate part in a pipeline (The architectures of generator and discriminator are nearly always the same except for some details in concepts, mostly GANs differs in loss functions)

* [Spectral Normalized GAN (SN-GAN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957) [[Folder with code]](https://github.com/zzmtsvv/adversarial/tree/main/sn_gan) (except the loss is as in Least Squares GAN)
* [Alpha GAN (Variational Approaches for Auto-Encoding Generative Adversarial Networks)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04987) [[Folder with code]](https://github.com/zzmtsvv/adversarial/tree/main/alpha_gan)
